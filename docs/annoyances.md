# Annoyances

This document contains a list of issues and annoyances that we have writing
Gleam code today, so that we can devise solutions to them in future.

## Cannot infer what targets a package supports

## Dynamic decoding boilerplate

## JSON (de|en)coding boilerplate

## Bundling compiled JavaScript is non-obvious

## Cannot shift repeated work to compile or initialise time

For example, regex compilation.

## No good story for creating CLI programs

## Runtime debugging is basic

Rust's `dbg!` and Elixir's `dbg` were mentioned as good additions.
