<p>
  Most commonly functions in the 
  <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/list.html"><code>gleam/list</code></a>
  module are used to iterate across a list, but at times you may prefer
  to work with the list directly.
</p>
<p>
  Gleam doesn't have a looping syntax, instead iteration is done through
  recursion and pattern matching.
</p> 
<p>
  The <code>[first, ..rest]</code> pattern matches on a list with at least one
  element, assigning the first element to the variable <code>first</code> and
  the rest of the list to the variable <code>rest</code>.
  By using this pattern and a pattern for the empty list <code>[]</code> a
  function can run code on each element of a list until the end is reached.
</p>
<p>
  This code sums a list by recursing over the list and adding each int to a
  <code>total</code> argument, returning it when the end is reached.
