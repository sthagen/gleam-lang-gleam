<p>
  Gleam's <code>Float</code> type represents numbers that are not integers.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike many languages Gleam does not have a `NaN` or `Infinity` float value.
</p>
<p>
  Gleam's numerical operators are not overloaded, so there are dedictated
  operators for working with floats.
</p>
<p>
  Floats are represented as 64 bit floating point numbers on both Erlang and
  JavaScript runtimes.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/float.html"><code>gleam/float</code></a>
  standard library module contains functions for working with floats.
